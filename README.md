# Social Network API [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This project serves as the backend API for a social network web application. It utilizes the power of NoSQL databases through MongoDB, combined with the Mongoose ODM to provide a flexible, efficient, and scalable platform for users to share thoughts, react to friends' posts, and manage a friend list. With the shift from traditional SQL databases like MySQL and the Sequelize ORM, the journey to mastering Mongoose and the schema-less nature of NoSQL was both challenging and intriguing, especially when it came to creating seed data and a seed script that would showcase the app's functionality. Also I found that using a modularized code structure, although initially daunting, proved to be a robust and efficient way to build and manage the application's components.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and run `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.

## Usage

Once you have completed the installation of the necessary dependencies, you should seed the database with initial data. This allows you to test the application's functionalities without having to manually enter data. To seed the database, run the following command: `npm run seed`

This will execute the seed script defined in package.json, which populates the MongoDB database with predefined data sets.
After seeding the database, you can start the server by running: `npm start`
