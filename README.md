# Social Network API [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This project serves as the backend API for a social network web application. It utilizes the power of NoSQL databases through MongoDB, combined with the Mongoose ODM to provide a flexible, efficient, and scalable platform for users to share thoughts, react to friends' posts, and manage a friend list. With the shift from traditional SQL databases like MySQL and the Sequelize ORM, the journey to mastering Mongoose and the schema-less nature of NoSQL was both challenging and intriguing, especially when it came to creating seed data and a seed script that would showcase the app's functionality. Also I found that using a modularized code structure, although initially daunting, proved to be a robust and efficient way to build and manage the application's components.
